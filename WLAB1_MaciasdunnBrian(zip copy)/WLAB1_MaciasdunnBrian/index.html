    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Located in Harnett County and incorporated in 1887, Dunn was originally known as "Lucknow" and renamed in honor of engineer Bennett R. Dunn, who helped establish the rail line through the area. 
        The town flourished thanks to the railroad and tobacco industries. 
        Its heritage is preserved by attractions like the General William C. Lee Airborne Museum, which honors a key military figure from Dunn. 
        Dunn's charm today lies in its close-knit community, historic downtown, and strong civic pride.
